The neurome project aim can be divided two parts:

- ##### 'proximal' goal #####
Complete construction and network analysis of macroconnection subconnectomes for the mammalian forebrain. 

- ##### 'distal' goal #####
Achieve this for all major brain parts, and eventually the entire nervous system, leading to integration with other brain data (such as gene-expression) at multiple levels of spatial resolution.

#### Chapter 1  Connection ####

In the connection section, the project main collects three part of connection, they are **Cerebral cortex**, **Cerebral nuclei**, **Hypothalamus**. Here mammalian animal model is Rat.

+ Cerebral cortex: provides a searchable list of region-to-region (macroscale) collated published connection reports (macroconnections) for the cerebral cortex of the rat. Currently, these data include reports of macroconnections within the cerebral cortex, and between the cerebral cortex and cerebral nuclei (basal ganglia).

+ Cerebral nuclei: provides a searchable list of region-to-region (macroscale) collated published connection reports (macroconnections) for the cerebral nuclei (basal ganglia) of the rat. Currently, these data include reports of macroconnections within the cerebral nuclei, and between the cerebral nuclei and cerebral cortex.

+ Hypothalamus: provides a searchable list of region-to-region (macroscale) collated published connection reports (macroconnections) for the hypothalamus of the rat. Currently, these data include reports of macroconnections within the hypothalamus (intrahypothalamic macroconnections).

Region nomenclature follows an open access atlas for the rat brain ([Brain Maps 4.0. Swanson, L. W. 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/cne.24381)). Part of figures see Appendix.

##### Connectome #####

<center>![human nervous system](Vesalius-nerveman-base.jpg)</center>
The human nervous system (Vesalius, 1543)

The term *“connectome”* was introduced by Olaf Sporns, Giulio Tononi, and Rolf Kötter in a 2005 paper, [The human connectome: a structural description of the human brain](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=Sporns+2005+connectome), where they stated that “The connection matrix of the human brain (the human ‘connectome’) represents an indispensable foundation for basic and applied neurobiological research.”

A complete connectome would include not just the brain, but the nervous system as a whole, along with the other systems of the body (muscular, endocrine, digestive, and so on) related to the nervous system (that is, providing inputs and receiving outputs)–a connection matrix that has been called a neurome (Bota et al., 2015, PNAS). Here is the general form of such a complete connectome, which, of course, is bilateral, representing the right and left halves of the body:

##### MAPPING CONNECTIONS ON STANDARD TEMPLATES #####

Since 1992, virtually all of the experimental pathway tracing analyses carried out by the Swanson group in rat have been mapped onto standard atlas and flatmap templates from the 3 editions of Brain maps: structure of the rat brain (Swanson, 1992, 1998, 2004). This approach greatly simplifies qualitative comparisons of connection patterns for different parts of the nervous system. The first example was for the connections of the posterior nucleus of the amygdala, and adjacent parts of the cortical nucleus of the amygdala (Canteras et al., 1992).

<blockquote>
<b>Abstract</b> <br/><br>

The fourth edition (following editions in 1992, 1998, 2004) of Brain maps: structure of the rat brain is presented here as an open access internet resource for the neuroscience community. One new feature is a set of 10 hierarchical nomenclature tables that define and describe all parts of the rat nervous system within the framework of a strictly topographic system devised previously for the human nervous system. These tables constitute a global ontology for knowledge management systems dealing with neural circuitry. A second new feature is an aligned atlas of bilateral flatmaps illustrating rat nervous system development from the neural plate stage to the adult stage, where most gray matter regions, white matter tracts, ganglia, and nerves listed in the nomenclature tables are illustrated schematically. These flatmaps are convenient for future development of online applications analogous to “Google Maps” for systems neuroscience. The third new feature is a completely revised Atlas of the rat brain in spatially aligned transverse sections that can serve as a framework for 3‐D modeling. Atlas parcellation is little changed from the preceding edition, but the nomenclature for rat is now aligned with an emerging panmammalian neuroanatomical nomenclature. All figures are presented in Adobe Illustrator vector graphics format that can be manipulated, modified, and resized as desired, and freely used with a Creative Commons license.
